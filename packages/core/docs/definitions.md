# Definitions and terms
Below you will find a list of definitions and terms that will be used throughout our code
documentation.

- `Application Developer`:
Developers consuming our webcomponents inside an application (not extending them).
Application Developers are only allowed to interact with `public` properties and methods.
Can be abbreviated as `AD`. Sometimes also called `Consuming Developer`.

- `Subclasser`:
Developers extending our webcomponents. For instance: `MaterialInput extends LionInput`.
Subclassers have access to protected methods (prefixed with an underscore or marked as protected),
but not to private methods.

<!-- TODO: extend these docs with those written before -->
- `public`:
Methods and properties are public when they are not prefixed by an underscore.
They can be used by Application Developers.
<!-- TODO: remove underscores where needed --->
- `protected`:
Methods and properties are protected when they contain one underscore or are explicitly marked as
protected in the code.
They can be used by Subclassers.

- `private`:
Methods and properties are protected when they contain two underscores  or are explicitly marked as
private in the code.
They can be used within the class where they are defined (developers of Lion components).
